In Rust, functions can be defined using the fn keyword. Functions can take parameters and return values. For example：

```rust
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```

The above code defines a function named add that has two arguments of type i32, x and y, and returns their sum. The last line of the function indicates the return value, which is a shorthand form of Rust. Functions can be called from other functions or modules, e.g.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    let sum = add(x, y);
    println!("{} + {} = {}", x, y, sum);
}
```

Modules in Rust are a way of organizing code; they allow developers to combine related functions, structures, and other types together. Modules help keep the code readable and maintainable, as well as control access to the code. A new module can be created using the mod keyword. For example:

```rust
mod my_module {
    fn hello() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
}

```

The above code creates a module called my_module with a function named hello defined. The module can be accessed in other functions or modules in the same file, for example:

```rust
fn main() {
    my_module::hello();
}
```

Rust also provides the pub keyword for exposing functions or other types to external modules. For example:

```rust
mod my_module {
    pub fn hello() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
}

```

The above code marks the hello function as public, so it can be used in other modules, for example:

```rust
use my_module::hello;

fn main() {
    hello();
}

```

In summary, Rust's functions and modules are key tools for organizing and controlling code, and they provide a clear way to organize code and control its visibility and accessibility. ￼￼￼
