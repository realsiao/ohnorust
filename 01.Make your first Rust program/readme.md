In Rust, you can make a "Hello, World!" program as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Save this code as a `main.rs` file and then compile and run it in the terminal/command line using the following commands:

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
```

The first command compiles the Rust code and the second command runs the generated executable. You should see the following output:

```
Hello, World!
```

And there you have it, your first Rust program!
