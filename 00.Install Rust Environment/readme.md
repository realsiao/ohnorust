### To install the Rust programming language environment , you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Download the Rustup tool: The Rust programming language uses the Rustup tool to manage installations of the Rust language and its associated tools. To download the Rustup tool, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Configure the environment : Once the Rustup tool has been installed , you can use it to configure your environment. You can do this by running the following command:

 ```bash
 rustup default stable
 ```
 
 3. Verify the installation : To verify that the Rust environment has been installed successfully , you can run the following command:
 
 ```bash
 rustc --version
 ```
 
 This should display the version number of the Rust compiler that has been installed on your system.

With these steps , you should have a working Rust environment set up on your system. You can now start writing and compiling Rust programs.
